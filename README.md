# Art_Gallery_Python_Web_Framework_Website


Open source website for viewing arts and paintings. This website is being built as my Python Web Framework project in Python Web Framework Module, Software Engineering, Software University.


### What's inside?
This website uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Django] - Python Web framework

* [Bootstrap] - My frontend framework

And of course this website itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.


### Development
To fix a bug or enhance an existing module, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b exciting-stuff`)
3. Make the appropriate changes in the files
4. Add changes to reflect the changes made
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'exciting-stuff!!'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin exciting-stuff`)
7. Create a Pull Request


### Interested?
If you find a bug (the website couldn't handle the query and / or gave irrelevant results), kindly open an issue [here](https://github.com/nedkoo/Art_Gallery_Python_Web_Framework_Website/issues/new) by including your search query and the expected result.

If you'd like to request a new functionality, feel free to do so by opening an issue [here](https://github.com/nedkoo/Art_Gallery_Python_Web_Framework_Website/issues/new). Don't forget to include some sample queries and their corresponding results.


### What next?
